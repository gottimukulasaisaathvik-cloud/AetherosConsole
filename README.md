# Aetheros Console

## Project Overview

**Aetheros Console** is an advanced analytics and data visualization platform for the Aetheros space settlement design project (Version 3.97). This repository hosts the analytics dashboard that provides insights into various aspects of the torus-shaped space habitat design.

### About Aetheros

Aetheros is a comprehensive entry for the **National Space Society (NSS) Gerard K. O'Neill Space Settlement Design Competition**. The project focuses on designing a sustainable, self-sufficient rotating torus space settlement that could house thousands of inhabitants in a realistic near-future scenario.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Analytics Dashboard**: Monitor and analyze project metrics
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Interactive charts and graphs for project analysis
- **Settlement Design Metrics**: Track parameters related to habitat design, life support systems, and resource management
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Accessible across different devices
- **Project Performance Tracking**: Monitor project milestones and team progress

## About the NSS Competition

The NSS Gerard K. O'Neill Space Settlement Design Competition challenges students to design realistically detailed space settlements using current technology and known resources. Aetheros represents a deep exploration of:

- Structural engineering for rotating habitats
- Life support systems and resource management
- Orbital mechanics and station positioning
- Environmental systems and sustainability
- Social and governance structures for space communities

## The Aetheros Design

Aetheros envisions a **rotating torus configuration** with:
- Advanced radiation shielding
- Artificial gravity through rotation
- Sustainable agricultural and manufacturing systems
- Multi-zone habitat design
- Robust communication systems
